In cages, digits must sum to the small clue in the top left corner of the cage.  Digits cannot repeat within a cage. Digits along arrows must sum to the digit in that arrow's circle.  One of the other 8 boxes is a hidden clone of box 4.  ie the hidden clone contains the exact same digits in the exact same positions as box 4.  eg if box 8 was the clone then r4c1 and r7c4 would contain the same digit."}

,{"id":"t9h6rqDj64","rules":"Normal sudoku rules apply. A river is a snake path of orthogonally connected cells starting next to a cage; the digit in that cage shows the length of the river. The number in the top-left corner of the cage shows the sum of the digits along the river. Rivers must strictly decrease in digit value, starting from next to the cage. Rivers must not include cages. Rivers may touch themselves orthogonally, and rivers may overlap."}

Digits along an arrow must sum to the number in that arrow's circle.  Digits may repeat along arrows if allowed by other rules. Digits in cages must sum to the small clue in the top left corner of the cage.  Digits cannot repeat within a cage. Cells separated by a black dot must have a 1:2 ratio.  Not all possible black dots are given. Clues outside the grid give the sum of the cells along the indicated diagonal.  Digits may repeat along such a diagonal."}

Symbols at the top of cells do the same comparing to the cell above. Clues to the left of the grid sum all cells in the row which only have - signs. Clues above the grid sum all cells in the column which only have + signs."}

Given two cells which both contain the digit N, the Euclidean distance between (the centres of) those cells must be at least √N times the sidelength of a single cell.

If you apply that operation to each pair of diagonal digits touching the circle then you'll get the number in the circle as the result BOTH times.  A circle with a ? instead of a number indicates that the result is the same for both pairs of digits but must be deduced.  If a circle does not contain an operator, the digit(s) in the circle must appear in at least one of the cells touching the circle."}
